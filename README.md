# HR Analytics
- **Author:** Raghav Anil Pillai

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the "HR Analytics" project, a comprehensive exploration of human resources data with a focus on data cleaning and visualization. In this GitHub-style project, we will delve into HR-related data to uncover valuable insights and patterns that can assist organizations in making informed decisions.

**Data Cleaning:**

Data Cleaning will be our first step in this project. We will perform several essential tasks, including:
- Deleting redundant columns.
- Renaming columns for clarity.
- Removing duplicate records.
- Addressing missing values.

These data cleansing procedures are critical for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our analysis.

**Data Visualization:**

Next, we will proceed with Data Visualization, which is instrumental in understanding the underlying trends and relationships within the HR dataset. We will create various visualizations to bring the data to life and reveal meaningful patterns. Some of the visualizations we plan to generate include:
- A correlation map for numeric variables.
- Specific visualizations for overtime, marital status, job roles, gender, education fields, departments, and business travel.
- Exploration of the relationship between overtime and various factors such as age, total working years, education level, number of companies worked for, and distance from home.

By embarking on this journey of HR Analytics, we aim to empower organizations with the tools and insights necessary to optimize their human resources strategies. Let's dive into the data and uncover the secrets it holds to make better HR decisions.
